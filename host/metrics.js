// histogram, never a room name, opaque room tag, or IP.
//
// The socket-lifetime histogram is the flap-cadence signal the recent close-time
// logging was reaching for: a spike in the short buckets means clients are
// connecting and dropping in seconds (the behavior that ran up the Cloudflare
// per-connection bill), now free but still worth watching.
//
// Rendered in Prometheus text format and served on a localhost-only endpoint.

// Cumulative upper bounds in seconds; the last (+Inf) catches everything.
