// The runtime shim that replaces the Cloudflare Durable Object platform for a
// single self-hosted process. It provides:
//
//   - DurableObject: the base class Room extends (just holds ctx + env).
//   - RoomContext: the per-room `this.ctx` — storage, the live socket set,
//     acceptWebSocket() wiring, and the alarm timer that fires room.alarm().
//   - Runtime: the registry that maps room name -> live RoomContext, rehydrates
//     persisted alarms on boot, and evicts idle rooms to bound memory.
//
// On Cloudflare each room was its own Durable Object, sharded across the edge,
// hibernated when idle, and woken by the platform to run its alarm. Here one
// process owns every room; an idle socket costs only a file descriptor, so
// there is no hibernation — a parked Mac just stays connected. The one thing
// the platform did for free that a single process must do explicitly is bound
// room cardinality: a room with no sockets and no pending alarm holds nothing
// worth keeping in memory, so it is evicted (its persisted state stays in
// SQLite and is rehydrated on next access).
