# The always-on heartbeat. No LLM. It samples tick.mjs on a timer and, only on
# SUSTAINED relay-shaped trouble (with this Mac's own internet healthy), POKES the
# live `claude` window in this same tmux session via `tmux send-keys`, so the
# interactive, phone-controllable Claude runs the triage and owns all user-facing
# output (the OSC 9 page, the incident report). The heartbeat only decides WHEN to
# wake Claude, and dedupes so you are poked once per incident (with an occasional
# nudge if it drags on). It never pages by itself, because an OSC 9 from this
# background window would not reach iTerm2 until you switched to it; Claude, in the
# window you actually attach to, is the right emitter.

================================================================================
 relay-watch heartbeat  -  the deterministic probe loop (no LLM).
 Quiet when healthy; a "tick ok" pulse prints each cycle, and real events
 (failures, poking Claude, recovery) print here and to state/heartbeat.log.
 The interactive watcher is the "claude" window: Ctrl-b p.
